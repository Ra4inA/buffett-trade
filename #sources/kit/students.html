                        Rahim was born in the slums of Mumbai, India. His first message was, "Please, can I have one free signal?" to which we naturally declined as we are a commercial organization, not a church. After that, he disappeared for a week. Then, he managed to find the money and bought a discounted subscription for one month. I don't remember how much it cost, but I do remember he had only $50 left for trading. It was a risky decision, wasn't it? After a month, he sent us a screenshot of his balance, which was $5000, and that's what we call a result. Five years later, he is one of our fund's investors and has earned more than $100,000 during that time.
